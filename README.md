# UNP_PYTHON_PROJECT_HEALTH-INSURANCE-DATASET
Our Python project focused on predicting medical insurance charges using demographic and health-related data. We applied machine learning techniques, including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest models, to analyze and predict costs. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we identified smoking, age, and BMI as the most significant factors influencing charges. The data preprocessing involved cleaning and transforming the dataset to ensure accuracy. The Random Forest model demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness in complex data analysis. This project provided insights into key variables impacting insurance premiums and enhanced our machine-learning skills.
